# Video maker

This script was created to process one kind of input video. Generalization of the code/algorithm was not demanded. Main algorithm is obtanined in method main(). 
Input is a video with a lot of noise. Output is a video where noise is reduced and pixels over significant edges are sharpened. There is also a video of frames wehere edges are detected. 

Individual methods can be used solo but was created for the purpose of this project especially.

Try to build a video with a help of method build_video() and images stored in folder: images, and then split it back with method split_video_to_frames().
